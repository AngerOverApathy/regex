# Go Regex Go
Regular expressions (i.e. Regex) aid search patterns via special characters. They can  be used to find and replace a character as well as validate items such as an email.

## Summary
The regular expression I will be explaining is: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
/`^`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})`$`/
The `^` anchor represents the beginning of the string, with the following character (in this case `(`) being the start of the string. The `$` anchor signifies the end of the string.

### Quantifiers
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]`+`)@([\da-z\.-]`+`)\.([a-z\.]`{2,6}`)$/
Quantifiers set the string limits that your regex will match. Essentially, they determine the minimum and maximum amount of characters your regex will look for. They are greedy, which means they will match as many patterns as possible.
`+` - matches the pattern one or more times
`{2,6}` - will match a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 6 times

### OR Operator
`|`
There is no OR operator in this regex. 

### Character Classes
/^([a-z0-9_\`.`-]+)@([`\d`a-z\`.`-]+)\`.`([a-z\`.`]{2,6})$/

Character classes define characters in a string that will meet a match.
`.` - Will match any character except \n (new line)
`\d` â€” Matches any numeral digit. This class is equivalent to the bracket expression 0-9.

### Flags
Because regex is a 'literal', expressions must be wrapped in brackets. The exception to this rule are flags. Flags go at the end of a regex and define extra limits or functions. There are no flags in this regex.

### Grouping and Capturing
/^(`[a-z0-9_\.-]`+)@(`[\da-z\.-]`+)\.(`[a-z\.]{2,6}`)$/
There are three groups in this regex. The first is the name of the account. The second will match the email provider (i.e. @gmail), and the third is the domain extension (i.e. .com).

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are the characters that appear in between the `[]` brackets. They outline the characters we want to include in our search.
`[a-z0-9_\.-]` - characters (including case sensitivity) from a-z, numbers from 0-9, underscore, periods and hyphens.
`[\da-z\.-]` - includes all digits, case sensitive characters from a-z, periods and hyphens
`[a-z\.]` - includes case sensitive characters from a-z and periods.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]`+`)@([\da-z\.-]`+`)\.([a-z\.]`{2,6}`)$/
As explained earlier, greedy means it will match as many patterns as possible. A lazy quantifier would be noted with a `?`
